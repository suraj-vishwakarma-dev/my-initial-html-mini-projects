# my-initial-html-mini-projects

These are my very first HTML projects, created just to **practice and learn HTML tags**.  
I believe the best way to learn is by **doing things practically**, so I am building these mini projects every day.  

My goal is to gradually improve my skills and eventually create **bigger and more complex projects**.
